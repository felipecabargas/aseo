ABOUT
-----

ASEO (spanish word for "cleaning") is a little program written in Python that (re)arranges your files on folders by extensions.

Actually it supports most common file extensions for most common filetypes (Audio/Video, Documents, Images, Installers, etc).

Next versions will provide support for more extensions and filetypes ( ** currently working on that ** ).

USAGE
-----

Execute via terminal: 

```bash
$ python aseo.py
```

To give a path to realocate files (for example with the Downloads folder):

MacOSX:

```
Please write the basepath of the files to be ordered: /Users/JohnDoe/Downloads
````

Linux:

```
Please write the basepath of the files to be ordered: /home/JohnDoe/Downloads
````

REQUIREMENTS
------------

UNIX based OS (Windows support will be added in the next version)
